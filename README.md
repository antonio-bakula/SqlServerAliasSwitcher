# SqlServerAliasSwitcher
Windows application that set MS SQL Server alias(es) with predefined groups.

Little application that solves problem connecting to SQL server for development. I got tired of constantly changing config
file that holds connection string (web.config in my case) and that file was under source control so I have to be carefull not
commit config file with temorary changes. I needed to change it because I have three environments where I work:
1. Home
2. My office
3. Any place else
